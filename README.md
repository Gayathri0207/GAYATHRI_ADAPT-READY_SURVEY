ADAPT READY SURVEY ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU 

PROBLEM  STATEMENT:
	As a junior business analyst , for the companies in America we intended to help with problems that  people are experiencing in the marketplace and help regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws to educate and empower consumers for informed financial decisions.

DATA DRIVEN INSIGHTS:
1.	Consumers expecting for student loans can trust the companies as they have low margin of complaints on their products.
2.	If problem occurred also, the connecting window for complaint filing is user friendly either via website or  via phone.
3.	Most complaints were closed with proper explanation thereby no need to worry  about transparency
4.	It should be noted that there were too much of disputes from consumers on the student loan product. So suggested to  verify every details before proceeding further.
5.	If you are a consumer from  California, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas make sure you double verify before any purchase because these states had highest complaint count.
6.	If the consumer is about to do a purchase from health or clubbing , verify it clearly because those had too much complaints as a sub product.
7.	Before complaining ,every consumer must note that the companies have their complains split into appropriate list. Mostly if the companies have the complaints under a misunderstood or isolated error list , its tough on getting an explanation from their end.
